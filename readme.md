A tiny code mainly for the application of CS/DA program
This is a tiny render using path-tracing alg, supports diffuse, mirror, glass materials. 
No transformation in at all lol :) 
The light and plane part are hard coded, didn't implement any early out technique or multi-threading because don't have enough lines left.
